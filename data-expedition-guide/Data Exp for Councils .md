# Data Expedition information for councils
A data expedition is a way of working with data from start to end. We use a modified version of the [School of Data data pipeline](https://schoolofdata.org/methodology/), which creates a narrative structure for the use of data. It identifies and builds upon individual skills and competencies, encourages team building and sets out a route that participants can follow to help identify and answer questions with data.
Data Expeditions consist of three workshops:
1. Questions workshop (½ day)
2. The main data expedition (1 day)
3. Storytelling workshop (½ day)

We begin in the Questions workshop by defining research questions that can be answered with data. These questions are then explored fully in the main Data Expedition. We then explore storytelling techniques to be able to take our findings and communicate them in a clear and compelling way.

Data expeditions bring together a diverse group of people from policy, community development and technical backgrounds in an action learning environment. Each expedition aims to explore themes and questions that are of interest to the council.

What the Data Expedition involves:
* It’s an Action Learning Set exercise to understand how to use data to solve problems https://www.bond.org.uk/resources/action-learning-sets
* It teaches a methodology and tools to use it.
* It includes hands-on work for all participants. 
* It is an opportunity to share your expertise and learn from the expertise of others.
* At the end of the process, you will get recommendations on how to work with data in the future and steps you can take.
* It is an opportunity to work in areas that you may not usually work in, and gives you a better picture of the whole process.
* It is fun but it will take you out of your comfort zone!

You don’t need to be a data analyst or expert. It’s not a hack day, and you won’t be expected to deliver a product. You won’t necessarily end the day with answers to your questions, but you will have learnt how to work and problem solve with data in new ways.


## About the workshop 

**The Questions Workshop** 

The Questions workshop takes participants through a methodology to define research questions that:
1. Will be used to form teams and will be explored in the main data expedition. 
2. Explore particular themes or problems that are of interest to you and any stakeholders.
3. Can be answered by exploring data.

For the Questions workshop, we recommend no more than 10 participants. If you attend the Questions workshop, you are expected to be able to attend the main expedition. Participants in the Questions workshop will lead groups for the main expedition.
